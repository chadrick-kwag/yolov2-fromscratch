# yolov2-fromscratch
trying to build yolov2 from scratch

- first trying to train with face dataset. single class.
- to catch a glimpse of the dataset format checkout `019_130.json`.
- the anchor points are calculated from the dataset. checkout `ckpt`
- there are good references to learn from. `darkflow`[https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow] is a project that is mainly studied along this project. key files that are studied are inside `compare_other`.
- `test_tools` contain etc files that are used to verify the progress.
